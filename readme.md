#Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.
Pull requests can be made in participating GitHub-hosted repositories/projects, classified with the Hacktoberfest topic.
You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.
##Rules

To get a prize, you must make four eligible pull requests (PRs) between October 1–31 in any time zone.

Pull requests prior to the rule change on October 3, 2020 at 12:00:00 UTC can be to any public repository on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted.

Pull requests following the rule change must be to a participating public repository on GitHub, and have been merged, labelled as hacktoberfest-accepted, or approved.

Pull requests labelled as hacktoberfest-accepted will count toward to Hacktoberfest from any public repository on GitHub, with or without the hacktoberfest topic.

The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the values of Hacktoberfest or the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants can earn a T-shirt or plant a tree.

To put the rules in a form consistent with the spirit of Hacktoberfest:

PRs count if:
Submitted during the month of October AND
Submitted in a public repo AND (
  The PR is labelled as hacktoberfest-accepted by a maintainer OR
  Submitted in a repo with the hacktoberfest topic AND (
    The PR is merged OR
    The PR has been approved
  )
)
